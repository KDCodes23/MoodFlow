# üéØ MoodFlow - AI-Powered Voice-First Emotional Wellness & Productivity Assistant

> *"Productivity that adapts to your humanity"*

MoodFlow is a revolutionary MERN stack application that combines voice-first task management with emotion-aware journaling. Using advanced sentiment analysis and speech recognition, it creates a personalized productivity experience that adapts to your emotional state in real-time.

## üåü Why MoodFlow?

Traditional productivity apps treat humans like robots - they expect consistent performance regardless of how you're feeling. MoodFlow recognizes that our emotional state directly impacts our productivity and creates a more humane approach to task management.

**The Problem**: Most people struggle to maintain productivity when dealing with stress, anxiety, or emotional challenges. Current task management tools ignore this fundamental aspect of human psychology.

**The Solution**: An AI assistant that listens not just to what you say, but how you say it, adapting your workflow to support both your productivity goals and emotional well-being.
